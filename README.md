Cart System Code Test
Baseline
Please build a cart system that can add multiple items, decrease item counts, and remove some item from the cart.
Time frame:
3 Days
Minimum Specification Test:
Create a container for the cart , it can be a function, factory, class, or anything which makes sense.
Create a function, method, or anything that can add an item into the cart.
Create a function, method, or anything that can remove an item from the cart.
Create a function, method, or anything that can decrease item count from the cart.
Build a list of products which can be added to the cart.
Push the codes into your personal github repository.
Written in Javascript is a plus, but if prefer another language to build the test is also OK.
Items Example:
You can use fields define in this test OR it will be nice if You can create Your own objects for the Item as an assumption.
{
"product_id": "V254",
"product_name": "Polo Shirt",
"product_price": 125000,
}

Extra Points if:
There are unit tests or test cases which cover the basic specification.
Implement a good git practices when building the test.
Adding types if using javascript, e.g. TypeScript or FlowTypes.
Not Mandatory but Nice to Have:
A very simple API which operates the cart system.
No need to be hosted, can be deployed on localhost.
A very simple UI which operates the cart system.
Mobile, Web, Desktop, or anything is fine.
A working backend - frontend cart system which combines both API and the UI
What We will be Looking at:
Your understanding of the codes you wrote. This is the most important thing.
If the codes working or not.
How clean the codes are.
Self documented
Clear variables naming
Balanced refactorization
Your demo during the interview
Extra Notes:
Assumptions are allowed and please describe the assumption during the demo.
